This is a little program that takes Spotify URLs and converts them into scannable STL files of the Spotify Code.
To use the Source Code, you need to have .NET 6.0 Runtime installed on your Machine. The program was initially written in .NET 6.0, but was later switched to .NET Framework to run without installing any additional dependencies for most users.
If the application still doesnt start for you though, download the latest update of [.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework)

Pretty straightforward, nothing more to say to that.
